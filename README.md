Hello World!
I am an upcoming website developer, I liked it as a hobby so...

Like most things in my life, I don't have any talent for it. This fact can make it very tedious for me to learn. My knowledge, so far, is self taught coming mainly from playing with code after completing online tutorials and help chats like the slack rooms set up for the framework I use. For the most part people are very helpful and friendly, however, there is always the lot that take their knowledge for granted and forget they too had to start somewhere, and the super talented who never seem to have not known anything.
