Hello World!
I am an upcoming website developer, I liked it as a hobby so...

Like most things in my life, I don't have any talent for it. This fact can make it very tedious for me to learn. My knowledge so far is self taught, mainly from online tutorials, and help chats like the slack rooms set up for the framework I use.
